Website for the Glasgow University Canoe Club (GUCC)

Project overview:

    :) GUCC Site will be an application designed to help the GUCC. As a GUSA club it has a large amount of supplies available for club members to borrow, but it is very difficult for members to know exactly what is available.
    
    Similarly for those who store the gear, there are challenges that lie in knowing where any given piece of gear is, who has borrowed it, and when it should be returned.
    
    Gear Store will reconcile these groups by providing a portal where equipment can be uploaded,  displayed and borrowed easily, as a catalogue, as well as managing the admin for those who store it. 
    It will also have information for people looking to join canoe club or information for current members about whats upcoming.
